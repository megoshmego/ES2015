Sure! Here's a revised version of the information, eliminating redundancies and including additional terms and definitions for flashcards:

1. Spread Operator:
- The spread operator, denoted by the ellipsis (`...`), is used to spread elements from an iterable (e.g., an array or a string) into separate individual elements.
- It can be used with array literals, object literals, function calls, and more.
- Example code snippet:
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(...numbers); // Output: 1 2 3
```

2. Rest Operator:
- The rest operator, also denoted by the ellipsis (`...`), is used to collect multiple elements into an array.
- It is used in function parameters to gather the remaining arguments into an array.
- Example code snippet:
```javascript
function sum(...numbers) {
  return numbers.reduce((total, num) => total + num, 0);
}

console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)); // Output: 15
```

3. Spread with Object Literals:
- The spread operator can also be used with object literals to copy properties from an existing object into a new object.
- Example code snippet:
```javascript
const obj1 = { name: 'John', age: 25 };
const obj2 = { ...obj1 };

console.log(obj2); // Output: { name: 'John', age: 25 }
```

4. Adding or Updating Properties:
- The spread operator can be used to create a new object based on an existing object while adding or updating specific properties.
- Example code snippet:
```javascript
const obj1 = { name: 'John', age: 25 };
const obj2 = { ...obj1, city: 'New York' };

console.log(obj2); // Output: { name: 'John', age: 25, city: 'New York' }
```

5. Combining Objects with Spread:
- The spread operator can be used to combine multiple objects into a new object by spreading their properties into the new object.
- Example code snippet:
```javascript
const obj1 = { name: 'John' };
const obj2 = { age: 25 };
const combinedObj = { ...obj1, ...obj2 };

console.log(combinedObj);
// Output: { name: 'John', age: 25 }
```

6. Spreading Arrays into Objects:
- Arrays can also be spread into objects, resulting in properties with indices as keys.
- Example code snippet:
```javascript
const colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];
const obj = { ...colors };

console.log(obj);
// Output: { '0': 'red', '1': 'green', '2': 'blue' }
```

7. Spreading Strings into Arrays or Objects:
- Despite being primitives, strings can be spread into arrays or objects, resulting in properties with indices as keys.
- Example code snippet:
```javascript
const str = 'Hello';
const arr = [...str];

console.log(arr); // Output: ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']

const obj = { ...str };

console.log(obj);
// Output: { '0': 'H', '1': 'e', '2': 'l', '3': 'l', '4': 'o' }
```

These terms and code snippets cover the concepts of the spread and rest operators, their usage with arrays, objects, and strings, and their ability to copy, combine, and gather elements.
