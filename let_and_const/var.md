Important terms and ideas:

1. var: A keyword in JavaScript used for declaring variables. Variables declared with `var` have function scope or global scope. They can be reassigned and redeclared, and if declared in the global scope, they become properties of the `window` object.

2. let: A keyword introduced in ES6 for declaring block-scoped variables. Variables declared with `let` have block scope, meaning they are limited to the block in which they are defined. They can be reassigned but not redeclared within the same scope.

3. const: A keyword introduced in ES6 for declaring block-scoped variables that cannot be reassigned. Variables declared with `const` have block scope and must be assigned an initial value at the point of declaration. They cannot be reassigned or redeclared within the same scope.

4. Scope: Refers to the visibility or accessibility of variables in different parts of a program. `var` variables have function scope, meaning they are accessible throughout the entire function they are declared in. `let` and `const` variables have block scope, meaning they are accessible only within the block they are defined in.

5. Hoisting: A JavaScript behavior where variable declarations are moved to the top of their scope during the compilation phase. Variables declared with `var` are hoisted, meaning they can be accessed before their declaration in the code.

Code snippet (Variable Scope with var):

```javascript
var song = 'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road';

function sing() {
  console.log(song);
}

sing(); // Output: 'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road'
console.log(song); // Output: 'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road'
```

In this code snippet, the variable `song` is declared with `var` in the global scope. It is accessible both inside and outside the function `sing()` because `var` variables have function scope.

Code snippet (Variable Re-declaration with var):

```javascript
var musician = 'Elton John';
console.log(musician); // Output: 'Elton John'

var musician = 'Alanis Morissette';
console.log(musician); // Output: 'Alanis Morissette'
```

In this code snippet, the variable `musician` is declared and assigned a value using `var`. It is then redeclared with the same identifier and assigned a different value. The redeclaration and reassignment are allowed with `var` variables.

Code snippet (Variable Hoisting with var):

```javascript
console.log(song); // Output: undefined
var song = 'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road';
console.log(song); // Output: 'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road'
```

In this code snippet, the variable `song` is accessed before its declaration. Due to hoisting, the declaration of `var song` is moved to the top of the scope, resulting in the first `console.log()` statement printing `undefined` instead of throwing an error.

The transcript explains the differences between `var`, `let`, and `const` keywords for variable declaration. It highlights that `var` was the only option before `let` and `const` were introduced, and it discusses the behavior of `var` variables, including reassignment, redeclaration, scope (global and function), and hoisting. The code snippets demonstrate these behaviors in practice.
