Important terms and ideas:

1. hoisting: The behavior in JavaScript where variable declarations (not initializations) are moved to the top of their scope during the compilation phase, allowing variables to be accessed before they are declared.

2. var: A keyword for declaring variables with function scope or global scope. Variable declarations with `var` are hoisted to the top of their scope, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

3. let: A keyword introduced in ES6 for declaring block-scoped variables. Variable declarations with `let` are not hoisted, and they are initialized at the point of the code execution.

4. const: A keyword introduced in ES6 for declaring block-scoped variables that cannot be reassigned. Variable declarations with `const` are not hoisted, and they must be assigned an initial value at the point of declaration.

5. Scope: Refers to the visibility or accessibility of variables in different parts of a program. `var` variables have function scope or global scope, while `let` and `const` variables have block scope.

6. Reassignment: Refers to changing the value of a variable after it has been declared. `var` and `let` variables can be reassigned, but `const` variables cannot be reassigned.

7. Redeclaration: Refers to declaring another variable with the same name within the same scope. `var` variables can be redeclared within the same scope, while `let` and `const` variables cannot be redeclared.

8. Mutability: Refers to the ability to change the contents or properties of a variable. `const` variables, although they cannot be reassigned, can have their contents or properties mutated for non-primitive types like arrays and objects.

Code snippet (Variable Hoisting with var):

```javascript
console.log(chickens); // Output: undefined
var chickens = ['Hen', 'Rooster'];
console.log(chickens); // Output: ['Hen', 'Rooster']
```

In this code snippet, the variable `chickens` is declared and initialized with `var`. Before the variable is actually declared, accessing it results in `undefined`. This is due to the hoisting behavior of `var` where the declaration is moved to the top of the scope during the compilation phase.

Code snippet (No Variable Hoisting with let):

```javascript
console.log(chickens); // Error: Cannot access 'chickens' before initialization
let chickens = ['Hen', 'Rooster'];
console.log(chickens);
```

In this code snippet, the variable `chickens` is declared and initialized with `let`. Unlike `var`, accessing the variable before its declaration results in an error because `let` variables are not hoisted.

Code snippet (Missing Initializer in const Declaration):

```javascript
const fish; // Error: Missing initializer in const declaration
let bird;
bird = 'Sparrow';
const cat = 'Tom';
```

In this code snippet, an attempt is made to declare variables `fish` and `cat` with `const` without providing an initial value. However, `const` variables must be assigned an initial value at the point of declaration, leading to an error. On the other hand, the `bird` variable is declared with `let`, and its value is assigned later in the code.
