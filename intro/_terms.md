Important terms and definitions:

1. TC39: The Technical Committee 39 (TC39) is responsible for the development and standardization of the ECMAScript language specification. It consists of developers, executives, and experts who propose and discuss new features for JavaScript.

2. Proposal Process: The formalized process introduced by TC39 for proposing and advancing new features in JavaScript. It consists of different stages: Stage 0 (Strawman), Stage 1 (Proposal), Stage 2 (Draft), Stage 3 (Candidate), and Stage 4 (Finished).

3. Stage 0 (Strawman): The initial stage where ideas can be proposed informally. It allows for the exploration of new concepts without much formality.

4. Stage 1 (Proposal): The first formalized stage where proposals require a champion from TC39. Demonstrations and usage examples are needed, but a specific implementation is not required.

5. Stage 2 (Draft): At this stage, the proposal becomes more refined and has stricter criteria. It has a higher chance of being included in the ECMAScript specification but is still subject to changes.

6. Stage 3 (Candidate): In this stage, proposals are considered stable, and major changes are unlikely. Browsers may start implementing these features behind experimental flags.

7. Stage 4 (Finished): The final stage where proposals are considered complete and ready for inclusion in the ECMAScript specification. They require at least two independent implementations passing tests.

8. JavaScript: A programming language created by Brendan Eich in 1995. It was initially developed as a scripting language for web browsers and has since become widely used for both client-side and server-side development.

9. Browser Wars: A period in the 1990s when web browsers from different companies, such as Netscape and Microsoft, competed with each other. This led to inconsistencies in JavaScript implementations and a lack of standardization.

10. JScript: Microsoft's version of the JavaScript language, developed as a response to Netscape's JavaScript. It introduced some incompatibilities with JavaScript, further adding to the fragmented landscape.

11. ECMAScript: A standardized scripting language for web browsers proposed by Netscape to bring consistency and standardization to JavaScript. It is defined by the ECMAScript specification, maintained by ECMA International.

12. ECMA International: Formerly known as the European Computer Manufacturers Association, ECMA is a standards organization responsible for defining and maintaining various standards, including the ECMAScript specification.

13. Standardization: The process of establishing rules, guidelines, and specifications to ensure consistency and compatibility. In the context of ECMAScript, standardization ensures that JavaScript behaves consistently across different browsers.

14. Fractured Landscape: Refers to the state of browser compatibility and support for new ECMAScript features, where different browsers may implement features at different times or not support them at all.

Code snippet (Stage 1 Proposal):

```javascript
// Proposed slice notation
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const sliced = array[1:4];
console.log(sliced); // [2, 3, 4]
```

In this code snippet, the proposed slice notation allows for concise slicing of arrays. However, it's important to note that this is not part of the current JavaScript specification and would require additional tools like Babel for compatibility.

Code snippet (ECMAScript Feature - Optional Chaining):

```javascript
// ECMAScript feature: Optional Chaining
const user = {
  name: 'John',
  address: {
    city: 'New York',
    street: '123 Main St',
  },
};

// Accessing a deeply nested property with optional chaining
const city = user?.address?.city
