Important terms and ideas:

1. TC39: The Technical Committee 39 (TC39) is the committee responsible for the development and standardization of the ECMAScript language specification, which JavaScript is based on.

2. Proposal Process: The formalized process introduced by TC39 for proposing and advancing new features in JavaScript. It consists of different stages, including Stage 0 (Strawman), Stage 1 (Proposal), Stage 2 (Draft), Stage 3 (Candidate), and Stage 4 (Finished).

3. Stage 0 (Strawman): The initial stage of the proposal process, where ideas can be proposed without much effort or formality. It allows for the exploration of new concepts.

4. Stage 1 (Proposal): The first formalized stage where proposals require a champion from TC39 to advance. Demonstrations and examples of usage are needed, but a specific implementation is not required.

5. Stage 2 (Draft): At this stage, the proposal is more refined and has stricter criteria. It has a higher chance of being included in the ECMAScript specification but is still subject to changes.

6. Stage 3 (Candidate): In this stage, proposals are considered to be stable, and major changes are unlikely. Browsers may start implementing these features behind experimental flags.

7. Stage 4 (Finished): The final stage where proposals are considered complete and ready for inclusion in the ECMAScript specification. They require at least two independent implementations passing tests.

Code snippet (Stage 1 Proposal):

Here's a code snippet demonstrating a Stage 1 proposal for slice notation:

```javascript
// Proposed slice notation
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const sliced = array[1:4];
console.log(sliced); // [2, 3, 4]
```

In this example, the proposed slice notation allows for concise slicing of arrays. However, please note that this is not part of the current JavaScript specification and would require additional tools like Babel to transpile it for compatibility.

It's important to remember that the code snippet represents a proposal and is not supported in all browsers or the official ECMAScript specification.

The transcript provides an overview of the proposal process and the different stages proposals go through before potentially becoming part of the JavaScript language. Understanding this process helps developers stay informed about upcoming features and changes in JavaScript.
