Important terms and ideas:

1. TC 39: TC 39 (Technical Committee 39) is the committee responsible for maintaining and updating the ECMAScript standard. It consists of developers, executives, and experts who discuss and propose new features for inclusion in the ECMAScript specification.

2. ECMAScript Release Process: The ECMAScript release process involves proposing, discussing, and deciding on new features to be added to the ECMAScript specification. In the past, releases were infrequent, but since 2016, there has been a shift to yearly updates, allowing for more frequent but smaller updates to the specification.

3. Annual Naming Convention: The ECMAScript versions are now named after the year of their release (e.g., ES2015, ES2016, ES2017). This naming convention replaced the older versioning system (e.g., ES3, ES5) and signifies the annual release cycle.

4. Open Development Process: The new ECMAScript release process includes an open and collaborative approach. It involves a GitHub repository where anyone can propose new features, and there are specific steps and guidelines for proposing and deciding on new features.

Code snippet (Arrow Function):

Here's a code snippet demonstrating the syntax for an arrow function, which is one of the new features introduced in ECMAScript:

```javascript
// Arrow Function
const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;
console.log(multiply(2, 3)); // Output: 6
```

The transcript discusses the process of how new features are added to the ECMAScript specification. It mentions TC 39 as the committee responsible for maintaining and updating the specification. The transcript highlights the transition from infrequent large releases to yearly updates and the introduction of an open development process with a GitHub repository for proposing new features. It also explains the shift in version naming to include the year of release.
