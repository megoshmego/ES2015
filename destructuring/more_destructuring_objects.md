The important terms and ideas discussed in the transcript are:

1. Default Values in Destructuring: Destructuring allows setting default values for variables that are being extracted from an object. If the value being destructured is `undefined`, the default value will be used instead.

Here's a code snippet demonstrating default values in destructuring:

```javascript
const options = {
  refreshTime: 10,
};

const { waitTime = 5 } = options;

console.log(waitTime); // Output: 5
```

In the above example, `waitTime` is being destructured from the `options` object. Since `options` does not have a `waitTime` property, the default value of `5` is used.

2. Renaming Variables in Destructuring: It is possible to assign a new name to the variable being declared during destructuring by using the colon (`:`) notation.

Here's an example of renaming variables during destructuring:

```javascript
const teaOrder = {
  teaName: 'Winter Sprout',
  brewTemp: 180,
};

const { teaName: tea } = teaOrder;

console.log(tea); // Output: 'Winter Sprout'
```

In the above example, the `teaName` property of `teaOrder` is being destructured and assigned to a new variable called `tea`. This allows the variable to have a different name than the property it is being extracted from.

3. Combining Default Values and Variable Renaming: It is possible to combine default values and variable renaming during destructuring. This allows providing a fallback value while also assigning the extracted value to a new variable name.

Here's an example combining default values and variable renaming:

```javascript
const teaOrder = {
  teaName: 'Silver Needle',
};

const { brewTemp: temp = 175 } = teaOrder;

console.log(temp); // Output: 175
```

In the above example, the `brewTemp` property is being destructured from `teaOrder`, and if it doesn't exist, the default value of `175` is used. The value is assigned to the variable `temp` instead of `brewTemp`.

Overall, the transcript explains how to set default values during destructuring, rename variables during destructuring, and combine both concepts to provide default values with renamed variables. It also provides code snippets to demonstrate these concepts.
