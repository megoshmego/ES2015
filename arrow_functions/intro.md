Let's evaluate the important terms and concepts mentioned in the transcript and provide code snippets for each of them:

1. Arrow functions: Arrow functions are a concise syntax for writing functions in JavaScript. They are particularly useful as replacements for callback functions and reduce the amount of code required for common operations.

Code snippet (Regular function expression):
```javascript
const add = function(x, y) {
  return x + y;
};

console.log(add(4, 5)); // Output: 9
```

Code snippet (Arrow function expression):
```javascript
const add = (x, y) => {
  return x + y;
};

console.log(add(4, 5)); // Output: 9
```

2. Using arrow functions as callbacks: Arrow functions are commonly used as callback functions, providing a more concise syntax for operations such as array mapping.

Code snippet (Array map with regular function expression):
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const doubled = numbers.map(function(x) {
  return x * 2;
});

console.log(doubled); // Output: [2, 4, 6]
```

Code snippet (Array map with arrow function expression):
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const doubled = numbers.map(x => x * 2);

console.log(doubled); // Output: [2, 4, 6]
```

3. Arrow functions and the `this` keyword: Arrow functions do not have their own `this` value but inherit `this` from the surrounding scope. This behavior can be different from regular function expressions.

Code snippet (Regular function expression):
```javascript
const cat = {
  name: 'Bubs',
  meow: function() {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
};

cat.meow(); // Output: Bubs
```

Code snippet (Arrow function expression):
```javascript
const cat = {
  name: 'Bubs',
  meow: () => {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
};

cat.meow(); // Output: undefined
```

In the second code snippet, the arrow function does not have its own `this` context and instead inherits the global `this` value, which is `undefined` in this case. Therefore, arrow functions are not suitable for methods that rely on the object's properties or methods.

These code snippets demonstrate the concepts discussed in the transcript, including the syntax and benefits of arrow functions, their usage as callback functions, and the behavior of the `this` keyword in arrow functions compared to regular function expressions.
