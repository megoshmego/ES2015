Certainly! Let's review the important terms and concepts mentioned in the transcript and provide code snippets that will help in learning this material:

1. Arrow functions: A concise syntax for writing functions in JavaScript.

Code snippet (Arrow function with one parameter):
```javascript
const greet = name => {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
};

greet('John'); // Output: Hello, John!
```

2. Implicit return: The ability to omit the `return` keyword and curly braces in an arrow function if there is a single expression in the body.

Code snippet (Arrow function with implicit return):
```javascript
const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;

console.log(multiply(2, 3)); // Output: 6
```

3. Babel: A popular tool used to transpile modern JavaScript syntax into browser-compatible JavaScript.

4. Transpiling arrow functions: How Babel converts arrow function syntax into equivalent code that works in all browsers, including Internet Explorer.

Code snippet (Transpiled arrow function):
```javascript
var double = function(n) {
  return n * 2;
};
```

5. Returning object literals: The importance of adding parentheses when returning an object literal in an arrow function to avoid confusion.

Code snippet (Arrow function returning an object literal):
```javascript
const makeObject = () => ({ mood: 'Meh' });

console.log(makeObject()); // Output: { mood: 'Meh' }
```

6. Keyword `this` in arrow functions: How arrow functions do not bind their own `this` context but instead inherit it from the surrounding lexical scope.

Code snippet (Usage of `this` in arrow function and regular function):
```javascript
const cat = {
  name: 'Whiskers',
  eat: function() {
    console.log(this.name + ' is eating.');
  },
  meow: () => {
    console.log(this.name + ' says meow.'); // `this` refers to the global scope
  }
};

cat.eat();  // Output: Whiskers is eating.
cat.meow(); // Output: undefined says meow.
```

The code snippets provided demonstrate the usage of arrow functions, implicit return, transpiling arrow functions with Babel, returning object literals, and the behavior of the keyword `this` in arrow functions compared to regular functions.
