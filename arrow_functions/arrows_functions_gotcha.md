Let's evaluate the important terms and concepts mentioned in the transcript and provide code snippets for each of them:

1. Returning an object from an arrow function: The need to use parentheses around an object literal when using an implicit return in an arrow function. This helps to avoid confusion with the function body.

Code snippet (Arrow function with explicit return):
```javascript
const makeMath = num => {
  return {
    square: num * num,
    double: num * 2
  };
};

console.log(makeMath(4)); // Output: { square: 16, double: 8 }
```

Code snippet (Arrow function with implicit return):
```javascript
const makeMath = num => ({
  square: num * num,
  double: num * 2
});

console.log(makeMath(4)); // Output: { square: 16, double: 8 }
```

2. The behavior of the `this` keyword in arrow functions: Arrow functions do not have their own `this` value, so they inherit `this` from the surrounding scope. This can cause differences in behavior compared to regular function expressions.

Code snippet (Regular function expression as a method):
```javascript
const cat = {
  name: 'Bubs',
  meow: function() {
    return `${this.name} says meow!!!`;
  }
};

console.log(cat.meow()); // Output: Bubs says meow!!!
```

Code snippet (Arrow function as a method):
```javascript
const cat = {
  name: 'Bubs',
  meow: () => {
    return `${this.name} says meow!!!`;
  }
};

console.log(cat.meow()); // Output: undefined says meow!!!
```

The second code snippet demonstrates that an arrow function does not have its own `this` context within an object method. Instead, it uses the global `this` value (which is the `window` object in the browser or `global` object in Node.js). Therefore, arrow functions are generally not suitable for object methods that require access to the object's properties or methods.

These code snippets illustrate the concepts discussed in the transcript, including returning objects from arrow functions and the differences in the behavior of the `this` keyword between arrow functions and regular function expressions.
