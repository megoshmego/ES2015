The important terms and ideas discussed in the transcript are:

1. Data Structures: Ways of storing and organizing multiple pieces of data.
2. Arrays and Objects: Built-in data structures in JavaScript for storing multiple values.
3. Maps: Data structures that store key-value pairs, allowing any data type as keys.
4. Key-Value Pairs: Data structure elements consisting of a key and a corresponding value.
5. JavaScript Objects: Used as a replacement for maps before the introduction of maps in JavaScript.
6. Map vs. Object: Distinctions between maps and objects, particularly regarding key types and conversion to strings.
7. `new Map()`: Syntax to create a new empty map.
8. `set()` method: Method used to add key-value pairs to a map.
9. Retrieving Values: Using the `get()` method to retrieve the value associated with a specific key.
10. Using Objects and Arrays as Keys: Demonstrating how references to objects and arrays can be used as keys in a map.
11. Iterating Over a Map: Two methods for iterating over maps: `for...of` and `for...each`.
12. Map Order and Size: Maps maintain the insertion order, and the `size` property indicates the number of key-value pairs.
13. `delete()` and `clear()` methods: Removing specific key-value pairs or clearing all pairs from a map.
14. `has()` method: Checking if a key exists in a map.
15. Converting Maps to Arrays: Using the spread operator `...` to convert maps to arrays for iteration or other purposes.
